        <h3>Description</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        An authentic Japanese street recipe, this dish can be cooked to order, featuring a wide array of meats, a non-meat protein like tofu, or a simple medley of chopped vegetables. Scrambled egg is at the heart of this dish, and favorite features include onions, carrots, peas, squash, and scallions. Despite the name, the dish is surprisingly nutritious! It also feeds a lot of people without breaking your back or your bank account.

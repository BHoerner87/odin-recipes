        <h3>Description</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        The gut-twisting, bowel-disrupting, blood sugar-upsetting dinner of your dreams.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Kraft Macaroni and Cheese</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Kraft Macaroni and Cheese box dinner</li>
        <li>1/4 cup 2% milk</li>
        <li>4 tbsp butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Mini Crescent Dogs</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>One can of Pillsbury crescent rolls</li>
        <li>One pack of cocktail weenies</li>
        <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Several slices of cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps (Mini Crescent Dogs)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°F.</li>
        <li>Prepare a plate to set your crescent roll pieces on.</li>
        <li>Prepare a baking sheet. There is no need to grease, but it also doesn't hurt anything if you do.</li>
        <li>Peel back label on can of crescent rolls and burst as indicated on packaging. Discard canister.</li>
        <li>Unroll and break apart into discrete triangles of bread goo.</li>
        <li>Cut each triangle into at least three other triangles. Figure out the best way to do this on a piece-to-piece basis, preferring long triangles wherever possible.</li>
        <li>Open your pack of weenies (sausage, hot dog, whatever you prefer) and drain it of gross preservative goo. Dry off weenies in a paper towel for easier handling. The crescent rolls will adhere more easily to less-slimey weenies.</li>
        <li>One after another, take a sliced triangle of crescent roll in your dominant hand, and a weenie in the other, and wrap the latter in the former. Like a pig in some sort of blanket.</li>
        <li>As you wrap your weenies, deposit them evenly across the baking sheet until there are no more.</li>
        <li>Place the baking sheet in the oven for 12-15 minutes. I happen to think they're perfect right at 12 minutes, but you might like a little more color to yours.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Steps (Kraft Macaroni and Cheese)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil about six cups of water</li>
        <li>Once boiling, add in noodles. Stir occasionally to keep them broken up and from adhering to the bottom of the pot where they will burn.</li>
        <li>After 7 and 1/2 minutes, drain the pot of water.</li>
        <li>Tear open the included cheese-flavored powder packet and empty over noodles.</li>
        <li>Add 1/4 cup milk.</li>
        <li>Add 4 tbsp butter.</li>
        <li>Stir until it all comes together and looks like the picture on the front of the box.</li>
    </ol>
